Polyp segmentation with deep ensembles and data augmentation

See the file "ExampleDataAugmentationDA2.m"  to replicate the data augmentation named DA2

the file saveMaskNoN.m transforms the segmentation mask to uint8 before to save it as a png file (you can use it instead of the saveMask.m file inside the .rar).
